Description: The function SurvRegCens() of this package allows estimation of a Weibull Regression for a right-censored endpoint, one interval-censored covariate, and an arbitrary number of non-censored covariates. Additional functions allow to switch between different parametrizations of Weibull regression used by different R functions, inference for the mean difference of two arbitrarily censored Normal samples, and estimation of canonical parameters from censored samples for several distributional assumptions.
